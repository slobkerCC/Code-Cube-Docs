Here's how we maintain top-level security throughout the process:</p> <ol> <li>One-Time Use of Service Account Key:<ul> <li>We keep your service account key secure by using it only once. The service account key, necessary for implementation, is never stored in our databases. This means that after the initial implementation, the key is discarded. Should you need to update your setup, you will be required to upload the key again. This approach eliminates any potential vulnerabilities associated with key storage.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Strict Separation of Front-End and Back-End Processing:<ul> <li>To minimize risk, the service account key file is never handled on the front-end. Instead, when you upload the key, it is sent as a binary file via secure HTTPS requests directly to our servers. By processing the key exclusively on the back-end, we prevent any exposure of sensitive information in the front-end environment, adding an extra layer of protection against potential security breaches.</li> </ul> </li> <li>No Credentials Stored:<ul> <li>In the event of a security breach, your credentials remain safe. Since we do not store the service account key or any sensitive credentials in our system, even a successful hack would yield no access to your Google Cloud resources. This ensures that your data and accounts remain secure, regardless of external threats.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Limited Scope of Resource Creation:<ul> <li>Our implementation is highly targeted and precise. We only create the resources explicitly required for the project within your Google Cloud environment, and nothing more. This controlled and minimalistic approach ensures that there are no unnecessary permissions or resources that could be exploited, further tightening security.           See the list of resources that will be created in your GCP project</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By following these strict security practices, we secure your implementation, reducing risk and protecting your Google Cloud environment.</p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/cloud-run-monitoring/#next-steps","title":"Next Steps","text":"<p>Enable Notification Methods  Set up your preferred notification methods (e.g., email or Slack) to receive alerts when an event occurs.

Here's how we maintain top-level security throughout the process:</p> <ol> <li>One-Time Use of Service Account Key:<ul> <li>We keep your service account key secure by using it only once. The service account key, necessary for implementation, is never stored in our databases. This means that after the initial implementation, the key is discarded. Should you need to update your setup, you will be required to upload the key again. This approach eliminates any potential vulnerabilities associated with key storage.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Strict Separation of Front-End and Back-End Processing:<ul> <li>To minimize risk, the service account key file is never handled on the front-end. Instead, when you upload the key, it is sent as a binary file via secure HTTPS requests directly to our servers. By processing the key exclusively on the back-end, we prevent any exposure of sensitive information in the front-end environment, adding an extra layer of protection against potential security breaches.</li> </ul> </li> <li>No Credentials Stored:<ul> <li>In the event of a security breach, your credentials remain safe. Since we do not store the service account key or any sensitive credentials in our system, even a successful hack would yield no access to your Google Cloud resources. This ensures that your data and accounts remain secure, regardless of external threats.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Limited Scope of Resource Creation:<ul> <li>Our implementation is highly targeted and precise. We only create the resources explicitly required for the project within your Google Cloud environment, and nothing more. This controlled and minimalistic approach ensures that there are no unnecessary permissions or resources that could be exploited, further tightening security.           See the list of resources that will be created in your GCP project</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By following these strict security practices, we secure your implementation, reducing risk and protecting your Google Cloud environment.</p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/tag-bulk-edit/","title":"Tag Bulk Edit","text":""},{"location":"tag-monitor/tag-bulk-edit/#update-all-your-tags-to-include-the-tag-name-in-the-metadata","title":"Update all your tags to include the tag name in the metadata","text":"<p>To effectively monitor your tags and ensure they include necessary metadata, follow these comprehensive steps to configure your client-side Tag Manager container.</p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/tag-bulk-edit/#step-by-step-implementation-guide","title":"Step-by-Step Implementation Guide","text":""},{"location":"tag-monitor/tag-bulk-edit/#step-1-access-the-tag-monitor-configuration-page","title":"Step 1: Access the Tag Monitor Configuration Page","text":"<p>Begin by navigating to the Tag Monitor configuration page on the Code Cube portal.
